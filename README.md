# Supermarket Code Kata

Your supermarket sells drinks, crisps and sandwiches. It also offers a meal deal, where one of each items can be
purchased for Â£3.00. You need to be able to calculate the price of a basket of items, based on the prices returned
`Cost()` method, and the special meal deal rule.

Implement the missing `Total()` method for the `Basket` to return the correct values. The tests provided should
pass when you have done this correctly.

The tests can be run with `./tests.sh`.  If that gets annoying, `go test` will achieve much the same thing, without
audio prompts.
